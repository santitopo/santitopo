### Hi there 👋

I'm a 🇺🇾 Uruguayan Systems Engineer from Universidad ORT, currently working as a 📱 Mobile Developer at December Labs. Here I have the opportunity to dive into challenging projects and create amazing mobile experiences for thousands of users in the 🇺🇸 USA.

🚀 Passionate about technology, I find joy in transforming complex problems into elegant solutions.  

💡 I'm a restless mind, constantly buzzing with new ideas. In fact, stay tuned because something new and exciting is coming soon...!  

🌍 Apart from software, I'm also intrigued by the mysteries of life and the beautiful world we live in.  

Let's connect and make a difference together!
